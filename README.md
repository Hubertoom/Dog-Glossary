# Dog Glossary

## About the project
Isnâ€™t it nice to see pictures of cute dogs on the Internet? <br/>
Thankfully in this project, you can watch some random dog pictures <br/> 
and a list of dog breeds using a public API. <br/>

## Learning outcomes
Practice handling APIs, HTML & JS to build a web page. Fetching data from <br/>
an API and displaying it on a web page. Also, work with promises and handle <br/>
different data structures.
